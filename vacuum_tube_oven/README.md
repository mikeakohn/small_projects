Easy Bake Vacuum Tube Oven
==========================

This is an exmperiment to see if a couple of vacuum tubes inside of
a thermos could cook some food.

An ATtiny2313 microcontroller has a connection to a thermocouple, a
couple MOSFETs to control if the vacuum tubes are on/off, and a
UART connected to a computer so XML data can be communicated.
